Strategy
--------
* CARE on animals is the single biggest edge in the game (measured against the real
  engine: sheep 4.25x, cow 3.27x, goose 2.08x lifetime output vs. never caring).
  Cows and sheep therefore get the tiles closest to the shed, where feeding is cheap
  in walking distance, and every animal is fed + cared every single day.
* Melon is the best crop per tile-day: 6 units per 10-day cycle at a $250 base, and
  a 30-day season fits exactly three cycles (plant day 0/10/19 -> harvest 10/20/29).
* Ongoing crops double their output if fertilised on production days AND harvested
  between productions (strawberry 4 -> 8 units). Animals hand us free fertiliser.
* The real constraint is market absorption, not production. Premium goods
  (melon/milk/wool/strawberry) crash to the $1 floor on modest gluts, while egg and
  wheat absorb almost unlimited volume. We spread across curves and meter selling so
  no price is pushed below a floor.
* Feed wheat is bought, not grown - a tile of wheat only feeds 0.67 animals for a
  season, so growing feed is a terrible use of land.
* Hands are extremely cheap (the first 15 in a day cost $1596 total, ~$4.4/action)
  against $90-150/action production, so we hire hard once cash allows. Land is
  bought early: NE is not just 25 tiles, it also unblocks the hand spawn squares
  (with only NW unlocked a hand spawning on (5,5) is permanently trapped).
